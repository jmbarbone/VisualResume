}
\arguments{
\item{titles.left, titles.right}{character. Vector of up to length three indicating labels to be shown in the top left / right.}

\item{titles.left.cex, titles.right.cex}{numeric. Vector indicating the size of the respective labels.}

\item{timeline.labels}{character. Vector of two labels for the top and bottom sections of the timeline.}

\item{timeline.cex}{numeric. Vector of length 2 indicating the size of the timeline text. The first element is for the main text, the second element is for the sub text.}

\item{timeline}{dataframe. Specifications of the elements in the timeline. See Details}

\item{milestones}{dataframe. Specifications of brief level-1 timeline milestones (at top of timeline). Should contain the columns \code{year} (integer) and \code{title} (character)}

\item{events}{dataframe. Specificaions of longer level-2 milestones (in bottom right plot). Should contain the columns \code{year} (integer) and \code{title} (character)}

\item{events.cex}{numeric. A size multiplier for level-2 milestones.}

\item{interests}{list. A list of length up to 4 indicating one's interests / skills. Each entry should be a character vector up to length 5. The more often a value occurs in the vector, the more pronounced it will be.}

\item{font.family}{character. An optional google font family. Run \code{sysfonts::font_families_google()} to see all of them. Only use when creating plot in a plotting device such as pdf()}

\item{col}{character. The color palette for the plot. Can be a named palette from the \code{yarrr::piratepal()} function (e.g.; \code{"basel"} or \code{"xmen"}), or a vector of named colors.}

\item{trans}{numeric. A number between 0 and 1 indicating the transparencies of the colors of boxes in the timeline.}

\item{year.steps}{integer. The step size in years of the year labels in the timeline.}

\item{year.range}{integer. A vector of minimum and maximum years to plot in the timeline.}
}
\description{
Creates a visual resume from dataframes specifying important events (e.g.; jobs or education) and interests / skills. The plot is optimized for an 8.5 in x 11 in display.
}
\details{
The argument \code{timeline} specifying events in the timeline should each be a dataframe with at least the following columns:
\describe{
 \item{title, sub}{character. Titles and subs}
 \item{start, end}{integer. Start and end years}
 \item{side}{binary. Vertical location of the event. 1 = top, 0 = bottom.}
 }
 If you want to adjust the locations of elements, you can specify the locations of timeline elements explicitly with additional named columns.
 \describe{
 \item{box.x0, box.x1, box.y0, box.y1}{numeric. Coordinates of the boxes.}
 \item{point.x, point.y}{numeric. Coordinates of the points.}
 \item{label.x, label.y}{numeric. Coordinates of the labels.}
 \item{label.dir}{string. Directions of the labels. Either "left" or "right".}
 }
 Note that the vertical axis of the timeline ranges from 0 (the bottom) to 100 (the top).
